# VS Code Devkit

### Important Disclaimers:

1. This project is not in any way affiliated with or endorsed by VS Code or Microsoft. It's just a very rough collection of tools I've hacked together for building VS Code extensions.
2. If you couldn't tell by that description, this is *seriously* barebones and probably doesn't work right. It is completely undocumented. It is in no way fit for third-party consumption. The only reason I'm even publishing it in its current state is so that I don't have to keep using `npm link`, because it's annoying.

That said, if you stumble across this and think it might be useful for your project, give it a shot! What's the worst that could happen? Feel free to open issues, feature requests or PRs.
